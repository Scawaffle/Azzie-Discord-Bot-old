# Azzie-Discord-Bot-old
A personal project discord bot made using javascript with discord.js api

it's a bit old and the code last written when discord.js 11 came out or in 2020, I start making it on 2018 or when discord.js v10 or 9 (idk i forgorüíÄ) came out 

# ‚ùì What this bot can do?
back then I intend this bot for server moderation, fun little game, and a music bot that can play music from youtube.

# ‚ùî Why this project got abandoned?
because the discord keeps changing their api and so discord.js api have to adapt to it; I was also on my final year on highschool

# ‚úÖ Do you plan continuing this on this project?
I'm planing to continuing this passion project in the mean time, so stay tuned!

# ‚ùì Why does your discord bot token still there?
nah don't worry I've change it so no one can access my bot directly
