# Azzie-Discord-Bot-old
A personal project discord bot made using javascript with discord.js api

it's a bit old and the code last written when discord.js 12 came out or in 2020, I start making it on 2019 or when discord.js v11 came out 

# What this bot can do?
back then I intend this bot for server moderation, fun little game, and a music bot that can play music from youtube.

# Why this project got abandoned?
because the discord keeps changing their api and so discord.js api have to adapt to it; I was also on my final year on highschool

# Do you plan continuing this on this project?
I'm planing to continuing this passion project in the mean time, so stay tuned!
