# Azzie Discord Bot(old)
## Description
This Discord bot is a personal project built using JavaScript and the Discord.js API. Originally created in 2018 using Discord.js v9 or v10 (which I cannot recall exactly), the bot has been updated to work with Discord.js v11. While the bot has not been actively maintained since 2020, it provides several useful features, including server moderation, trivia and word games, and a music bot that can search and play music from YouTube. The bot's code is open source and available for anyone to use or contribute to.

## Instalation
This bot was last written in Discord.js v11, which is an outdated version of the library. As a result, the bot may not run properly without significant modifications to the code. Therefore, we recommend that you do not attempt to install or use this bot. If you are interested in creating your own Discord bot, we recommend using the latest version of Discord.js and following the documentation provided by the library.

## FAQ
### ❔ Why did you choose javascript for your discord bot?
I picked JavaScript as the programming language for my Discord bot because it's well-liked and easy to use. JavaScript is a commonly used programming language with a big and lively community. This means that there are lots of resources available to help me learn and solve problems. Furthermore, JavaScript is an interpreted language, so I don't need to compile my code before running it. Lastly, there are plenty of libraries and frameworks available that make it easy to build a Discord bot with JavaScript.

### ❓ What this bot can do?
Originally, I created this bot for server moderation, as well as to provide a fun little game and a music bot that can play music from YouTube. It includes moderation commands such as banning and kicking users, as well as game commands for trivia and word games. The music bot allows users to search for and play songs from YouTube.

### ❔ Why this project got abandoned?
This project was abandoned because Discord kept changing its API, and the Discord.js API had to adapt to these changes. Additionally, during my final year of high school, I had to focus on my studies and could not devote as much time to the project.

### ❓ Do you plan continuing this on this project?
Yes, I plan to continue working on this passion project in my free time; I aim to improve its functionality and add new features. I'll add the new repo link here once it's online; so stay tuned!

### ❔ Why does your discord bot token still there?
Don't worry, I have changed my bot token so no one can access it directly.

## Credits
This Discord bot was built with the help of various online resources and tutorials.
