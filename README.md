# Azzie Discord Bot(old)
## Description
A personal project discord bot made using javascript with discord.js api. it's a bit old and the code last written when discord.js 11 came out or in 2020, I start making it on 2018 or when discord.js still on v10 or 9 (idk i forgorüíÄ) came out.

## Instalation
none, aside of that this code are written in discod.js v11 and the latest vesion of discord.js are on version 14; I doubt it will run either way without changinf some of the line code here and there

## FAQ
‚ùì What this bot can do?

back then I intend this bot for server moderation, fun little game, and a music bot that can play music from youtube.

‚ùî Why this project got abandoned?

because the discord keeps changing their api and so discord.js api have to adapt to it; I was also on my final year on highschool

Yes, I'm planing to continuing this passion project in the mean time, so stay tuned!

‚ùì Why does your discord bot token still there?
